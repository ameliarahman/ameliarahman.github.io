I was so curious how we can test and analyze our queries when there are certain concurrent users accessing the our database at specific times.
During my search, I came across a tool that is already included with PostgreSQL: pgbench.

As stated from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html" target="_top"> PosgreSQL Documentation</a>:

>pgbench is a simple program for running benchmark tests on PostgreSQL. It runs the same sequence of SQL commands over and over, possibly in multiple concurrent database sessions, and then calculates the average transaction rate (transactions per second). By default, pgbench tests a scenario that is loosely based on TPC-B, involving five SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT commands per transaction. However, it is easy to test other cases by writing your own transaction script files.

As what I get by asking from GPT:
>TPC-B, Transaction Processing Performance Council Benchmark is a benchmark used to evaluate the performance of transaction processing systems, like the number of transactions per second that can be processed. Specifically, it's a test designed to simulate the performance of a database system under heavy transaction load.

Here's my docker compose to start:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ameliarahman/18ca7ec9a3169b83f16f6c7df6183100.js"></script>

Let's go inside the container:
```
docker exec -it postgres_pgbench bash
```

We can make sure that pgbench is automatically included by running this command:
```
which pgbench
```

### Initialization
Now, let's initiate the pgbench:
```
pgbench -i [ other-options ] dbname
```
Since I already have the database under the name `db` with the user `user`, the full command is below:

```
pgbench -i db -U user
```
- -i means initialization, this command creates 4 default tables to test: 
`pgbench_accounts, pgbench_branches,pgbench_history, and pgbench_tellers`, and drop any existing tables of these names.
- By default, this will contain specific rows for each table in scale factor `1`:

    Table            |     Rows
    -----------------|----------------
    pgbench_branches |  1
    pgbench_tellers  |  10
    pgbench_accounts |  100000
    pgbench_history  |  0
    
    We can insert more rows by simply adding `-s `(scale factor) option.

And here is the result if I try to execute the command with `-s` option:

```
pgbench -i db -s 100 -U user
```

And how many rows created when scaling up to 100:

### Benchmarking
After the initialization, then what can we do to benchmark our database performance? After reading postgres documentation, asking Chat GPT, and also other resources. Here's the example command that we can execute to run scenario of load test the performance (of course there are still many options that we can use referring to official documentation):

```
pgbench -U <user> -d <database> -T <duration_in_seconds> -c <number_of_clients> -j <number_of_threads> -P <number_of_second>
```
- -U: User of database
- -d: The name of database
- -T: Duration in seconds to execute the test
- -c: Simulation number of concurrent clients that access our database. The default is 1.
- -j: Number of worker threads.
- -P: Show progress report every certain seconds/

Let's see what will happen after executing the command:
```
pgbench -U user -d db -T 200 -c 100 -j 5 -P 5
```
 
And here is the result:

Let's break down one by one:
- The first line means the pgbench is starting `vacuum` to clean up dead rows and optimize the database during the benchmark. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html" target="_top"> Read more about vacuum in postgresql</a>.
- The `progress` line indicates the benchmark situation every 5 seconds.
- Transaction type, as stated above that the `pgbench tests a scenario that is loosely based on TPC-B, involving five SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT commands per transaction`
- Scaling factor that I already set up to 100
